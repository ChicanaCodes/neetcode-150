def reverse_linked_list(head):
    '''
    Given a linked list, reverse the list and return the reversed list. 

    Edge Cases:
    - Can the list be empty?
    - What values can the list contain?
    - What is the maximum length of the list?
    - What is the minimum length of the list?
    - What is the expected input format?
    - What is the expected output format?


    Approach: 
    - Iterate through the list and reverse the pointers of the nodes.
    - Return the new head of the reversed list.
